Critical Thinking can be thought of as the capacity to reflect upon question and evaluate the validity of information that one is presented with. For example, when we are confronted with online health information, it is important to be able to assess the reliability of the information. The information may be completely wrong and believing it could cause excess worry (or much worse). So the core of critical thinking is arriving at an idea of the world which is closer to how it is instead of how we would like it to be in an ideal world. Having this clearer picture of the world is a large part of being able to effectively face lifeâ€™s challenges.
