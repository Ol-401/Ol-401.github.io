title: What is the point of Critical Thinking?
date: 2020-04-03

From what I have experienced, most disciplines are composed largely of facts which tell us what to think, wheras critical thinking is a methodology for how to think. A methodology which seems to show up everywhere in life:

Health:
* Is this information regarding a health condition genuinely        reliable or is it potentially harmful to me?
* Am I being mislead into believing false information about the body and mind?

Finance:
* Is this offer a great opportunity or a scam?
* Is the way I think about financial decisions in my long-term interest or am I just going with what I feel like in the moment?

Relationships:
* When faced with interpersonal conflict, do I consider the othersâ€™ perspective or react impulsively?

Work:
* Can I manage issues arising at work effectively or become blind to the larger picture around me?

Everyday behaviour:
* Do my habits align with my values and goals or are they determined by automatic behaviours?


I do not believe that Critical Thinking is something that will ever be able to provide absolute certainty. But cultivating a questioning, reflective and critical nature will help one navigate this world of overflowing information. The path may be winding, but it is one worth walking, so I invite you to explore with me this labyrinth of truth and illusion.
