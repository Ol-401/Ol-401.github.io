**What is Music?**

Music is usually thought of as organised sounds, but this asks why disorganised sounds could not also be classified as music. If music can be disorganised, then our definition of music becomes synonymous with just ‘sound’, if music is specifically organised then it suggests that some works belonging to Free Jazz, Experimental electronic , Avantgarde classical works (for example Ligeti’s Requiem) do not in fact fall into our definition of music due to their apparent lack of internal structure. On the other hand, it may be the case that this music has organisational structure, but it requires either training or extreme musicianship in order to appreciate the organisation. 
 
If music can be characterised as organised sound, then **what type of or organisation is permitted? What do we actually mean by organisation? Is organisation something within the perceiver’s mind or intrinsic to the music itself?**

At first glance it seems that organisation may be intrinsic to the music because one is able to sit down with the written score and spot patterns in the notes, instruments and harmony. This implies that the organisational structures within music are independent from how it is audibly perceived by the listener. On the other hand, it doesn’t take too long to find two people who disagree on what genre is real music. One genre of music could seem nothing more than a random amalgamation of sounds to one person but an absolute classic to another. This fact suggests a more subjectivist account of music (this point is similar to the Subjectivist/Objectivist discussion on aesthetic appreciation). The Subjectivist may then argue that the patterns discerned by analysing the score are also subjective and in fact there are no objective account of what is a pattern within music to begin with.
**But if it is all subjective then why do people generally agree on good types of music?**

**Would it be possible to come up with a solution to this problem which does not rely on the Subjective/Objective divide within music?** 

One interesting idea which sidesteps the Objective/Subjective divide I have come across is conceptualising music as having a particular orientation towards eliciting a specific emotion, activity or experience. Under this view of music, a Waltz would be music because it facilitates dancing, “Fast Cars” is music because it creates a sense of sentimental longing in the listener and the noises at the gym coming out of the speakers is music because it motivates one to move their body. Here, music is not understood as a collection of attributes but as having an orientation towards a particular experience, emotion or experience.

This would mean that the appreciation of music is neither subjective nor objective but contextually dependent on the experience, emotion or activity it is tied to. So someone who never dances to electronic music may not consider this genre to be real music, contrarily to someone who does dance to electronic music often.

**But is it only experience, emotion or activity?**

**Why is this type of music related to this experience, is it something intrinsic to the structure of the music, past associations, cultural conditioning, randomness?**

**Does music represent something? If it does, what is the nature of this something?**
