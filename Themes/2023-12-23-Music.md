**What is Music?**

Music is commonly thought to be sound which follows a pattern. The regular pulse of a drum beat or the reoccurrence of a melodic theme demonstrate an organised structure which we humans identify to be music. 

Here, organisation is the regular, structured and predictable arrangements of and entity’s elements. Cities are organised because they contain roads, buildings and people which follow predictable rules. The people cross the road and reside inside the buildings not the other way around. Similarly the human body is organised because it contains organs such as the kidneys, heart lungs etc.. all providing a specific and predictable functions. The heart pumps blood around the brain not the lungs. Both the human body and a city contains elements which follow regular, structured and predictable patterns and are therefore organised. In fact, almost everything we give a name can be considered as organised in some sense, but let us think about the organisation of music. 

If music can be characterised as organised sound, then **what type of organisation is it? Is organisation something within the perceiver’s mind or intrinsic to the music itself? Does the particular organisation of a piece of music say anything about the listener?**

**Could it be the case that music only appears to be organised to us and in fact there may be no intrinsic organisation to the music?** 
At first glance it seems that organisation may be intrinsic to the music because we can sit down with the written score and spot patterns in the notes, instruments and harmony. This implies that the organisational structures within music are independent from how it sounds. On the other hand, it doesn’t take too long to find two people who disagree on what type of music is _real music_. One genre of music could seem nothing more than a random amalgamation of sounds to one person but a classic to another. This suggests that the organisation of the music may not be inside the music itself but the mind of the listener, this is why the two listeners perceive the same piece of music differently. Moreover, this point of view could also say that the patterns discerned by analysing the score are also subjective and in fact there are no objective account of what is a pattern within music to begin with.
**But if it is all subjective then why do people generally agree on good types of music?**

**Would it be possible to come up with a solution to this problem which does not rely on the Subjective/Objective divide within music?** 

One interesting idea which sidesteps the Objective/Subjective divide I have come across is conceptualising music as having a particular orientation towards eliciting a specific emotion, activity or experience. Under this view of music, a Waltz would be music because it facilitates dancing, “Fast Cars” is music because it creates a sense of sentimental longing in the listener and the noises at the gym coming out of the speakers is music because it motivates one to move their body. Here, music is not understood as a collection of attributes but as having an orientation towards a particular experience, emotion or experience.

This would mean that the appreciation of music is neither subjective nor objective but contextually dependent on the experience, emotion or activity it is tied to. So someone who never dances to electronic music may not consider this genre to be real music, contrarily to someone who does dance to electronic music often.

**But is it only experience, emotion or activity?**

**Why is this type of music related to this experience, is it something intrinsic to the structure of the music, past associations, cultural conditioning, randomness?**

**Does music represent something? If it does, what is the nature of this something?**


**If Music can represent, can is teach us about certain domains of knowledge?**

**If music can represent then can it also negate, and if so, how does it do so?**

**Do musical forms converge and settle on predictable patterns in the same way stories do? What does this say about ourselves?**

**What are the limits of music?**

**Does music provide perspectives for us to look at the world through?**
