**What do we mean by vegetal? How do we as Humans relate to the vegetal world? How have we done in the past, and how has this relationship changed?**

**Do plants communicate? If they do, what is the nature of the language they use to communicate?**

Allomones are chemical messages that benefit the emitter, but are detrimental for the receiver. Neem trees release a chemical protecting themselves against insect attacks for example. This type of communication benefits one party and the expense of the other. **I wonder, what insights can this give to human behaviour? Is it not common for people to say things which are beneficial to them yet socially detrimental to others?**
Paradoxically, there are also kairomones which benefit the receiver and disadvantage the emitter. From what I understand, this is a way for the receiver to gain information about the emitter. For example, the Parasitoid wasp will track the prey using scent (the kairomone on this case). This is a  form of eavesdropping which directly benefits one party at the detriment of the other. **Yet is human communication also not like this?** Often, humans eavesdrop and spy on other humans to gain an advantage. 
**Is the majority of our human symbolic communication based around this game of gain and loss much like the game of winners and losers that plants and insects play with their chemical messages?**

**Can we learn from the non-human organic world of plants? If so, how?**
