  Welcome! This is a website maintained by me, a British university student who most certainly does not know all the answers. This place and time is a collection of reflections and tools to help one think more creatively and critically in the information age. My aim is to provide resources to help others (and myself)  think more critically about the the decisions made on a day to day basis. Whether it is choosing what to believe, what habits to form or how to respond to a practical challenge. I hope to explore how clearer thinking can lead to wiser decisions.
