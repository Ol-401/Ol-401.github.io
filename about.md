<p class="message">
  Welcome! This is a website maintained by me, a British university student who most certainly does not know all the answers. This place and time is a collection of reflections and tools to help one think more creatively and critically in the information age. My aim is to provide resources to help others (and myself) to think differently and ask more questions. Whether it is choosing what to believe, what habits to form or how to respond to a practical challenge. I hope to explore how clear and creative thinking can lead to wiser decisions.
