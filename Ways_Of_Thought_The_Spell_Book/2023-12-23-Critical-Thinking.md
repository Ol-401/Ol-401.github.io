# Critical Thinking

## **What is Critical Thinking?**

Critical thinking is the ability to carefully analyse and evaluate information, to form reasoned beliefs. As the Foundation for Critical Thinking defines it, “Critical thinking is self-guided, self-disciplined thinking which attempts to reason at the highest level of quality in a fair-minded way.” Developing this skill is not only applicable to theoretical topics but also to many aspects of life. 

I find that everyday life contains a constant stream of decisions. What is the best way to do this task? Should I believe this source of information? How can I solve this problem? Critical thinking offers a methodology to approach decisions such as these. It also offers a way of dealing with decisions that we know we should do, yet cannot because of the emotions we have. 
Moreover, some psychological research suggests a link between critical thinking ability and mental health developing a type of self awareness that encourages intellectual self-sufficiency. Meaning you can more confidently come to a conclusion by yourself instead of trusting the words of others in many areas of life. 
I have tried to present some useful critical thinking techniques which are not commonly talked about for those who are curious, serving as a spring board for further learning. A lot of the informational content from this page comes from the book “Critical Thinking- the basics” by Stuart Hanscomb and the Internet encyclopaedia of philosophy’s entry on Critical Thinking.

## Poor and Effective reasoning (How to reason effectively):

When we come to a belief about the world it usually takes the form of arguments. Arguments are composed of reasoning steps to justify a conclusion. Generalisations, Analogies and causal reasoning are three common techniques used in justification. These three reasoning steps can be done well or poorly, and being able to tell the difference allows us to build stronger arguments.

### Generalisations

Generalisation extends a statement that may be true for a particular occasion or group to all occasions or all groups. For example, if brewing a cup of tea and snuggling up with a good book is something that you have enjoyed doing in the past, then it would be a generalisation to say you will enjoy sitting down with your favourite book and a cup of hot tea this evening. When we say something like this, we generalise past experiences we have had to the future. Another case of generalisation is when we meet someone (let’s say Dominic) for the first time, and he seems polite and friendly. We might quickly assume that he is always like this. But if, in reality, Dominic has less kind intentions, our generalisation from a single encounter could mislead us. This is a case in which we may be tempted to generalise this single interaction to who they are as a whole, possibly steering us into a sticky situation we may ordinarily wish to avoid. 

Generalisations appear in many shapes and sizes, they are often intuitive once pointed out, yet they are commonly ignored resulting in poor decisions. Critical thinking encourages us to spot generalisations and to distinguish between strong and weak generalisations. A reasonable generalisation uses a large and representative body of experience or evidence while an unreasonable generalisation relies on unrepresentative or a small set of data. Our tea example could be a strong generalisation if drinking tea while reading is something we have done for a long time (a large sample size). It is also representative since we are making the statement about ourself. On the other hand, when we assume that Dominic is a nice person, we base it off a single encounter with him. Moreover we have no idea as to whether Dominic normally behaves as he did in that first encounter with us. Distinguishing between weak and strong generalisations can help making decisions and forming beliefs. Generalisations are one way we can arrive at conclusions from evidence, another is through the use of Analogy.

### Analogy

Analogy works by comparing two different situations and highlighting their similarities, often to help us understand something unfamiliar or to justify a decision. For example, imagine you are learning to drive a car for the first time, and someone explains it by saying, “Driving is like riding a bike — at first it feels awkward, but once you learn, it becomes second nature.” This analogy helps make sense of driving by drawing on an experience you already understand. In another case, a politician might argue that “running a country is like running a business,” suggesting that the same skills apply in both contexts. Whether or not that analogy is useful depends on how relevant and accurate the similarities actually are.
Analogies, like generalisations, can be strong or weak depending on the evidence and context. A strong analogy draws on similarities that are directly relevant and meaningful, helping us reason more clearly. In the driving example, both cycling and driving involve coordination, learning through practice, and developing habits that eventually feel automatic. A weak analogy, however, relies on misrepresentative comparisons between two scenarios which look similar on a surface level, however are in fact quite different. The claim that running a country is like running a business can gloss over important differences: a government doesn’t primarily strive to make profit, but to maintain the welfare of its citizens, and the complexity of national decision-making far exceeds that of a single business. Critical thinking encourages us to test analogies with care; asking whether the similarities really matter and whether the differences undermine the comparison. By doing so, we avoid being persuaded by analogies that appear to be convincing but fall apart under close examination.
The quality of an analogy is not always clear cut and can depend on the point being made. Some may view the comparison between learning to drive a car and learning to ride a bike as quite distinct as you have to furiously pedal at times and exhaust yourself in the process when riding a bike, wheras that’s not the case when driving a car. But it could be argued that this difference isn’t relevant to the fact that they both feel second nature once learned. So when evaluating analogies we should ask. Do the differences between these two scenarios undermine the point being made?

### Causal Reasoning

Causal reasoning is when we try to explain why something happens by linking causes to effects. For instance, if you wake up feeling groggy after staying up late, you might reason that your tiredness was caused by a lack of sleep. Similarly, if a new policy is introduced at work and productivity drops soon after, someone might conclude that the policy itself caused the decline. In both cases, we search for an explanation by connecting events together in a chain of cause and effect.
However, like generalisation and analogy, causal reasoning can be done well or poorly. A strong causal claim is supported by clear evidence and careful consideration of other possible explanations. For instance, years of medical studies showing that smoking leads to lung cancer provide strong grounds for a causal link, since the relationship is consistent and alternative causes have been accounted for. A weak causal claim, on the other hand, arises when we confuse correlation with causation or overlook other influencing factors. One common mistake is the post hoc fallacy — assuming that because one event follows another, the first must have caused the second. For example, if you start wearing a new pair of shoes and then get a promotion at work, it would be a mistake to think the shoes caused your success. Similarly, noticing that ice cream sales and drowning incidents both rise in summer does not mean one causes the other — both are linked to a third factor: hot weather.
It can be interesting to switch the cause and effect in an argument. For example, my mind will occasionally say: perhaps we should skip exercise today because we are tired. In other words, tiredness is the cause of why we should skip exercising.  If we switch the cause and effect the statement becomes: we are tired because we skip exercise. This reversal changes our perspective. It is common knowledge that regular exercise can increase our energy over a long term but this example illustrates that if we didn’t know that exercise helps with energy, then reversing the cause and effect can give us enlightening new insights.  Switching cause and effect in other scenarios may lead us to ponder the deeper connections between two events. We know that music can cause us to experience emotions, but can emotions help us to listen to music more intensely? 

## How to cultivate critical thinking:

Unfortunately, critical thinking is not easy. It is a skill like any other requiring consistent effort. Making a habit of practicing critical thinking perhaps a few minutes a day to begin with and gradually building up will help develop this skill as an effective tool for making decisions and solving problems in life. There are many ways to practice what you learn from critical thinking. The essence is to find an argument being made, and to apply what you’ve learnt from critical thinking. Does this analogy minimise differences? Is their evidence representative? What happens if we switch the cause and effect? Arguments or assertions can be found abundantly: articles, talking with friends, books, and especially your own thoughts. If you would like to improve your critical thinking skills then try to find assertions where you can and apply critical thinking techniques to them. 


## The relation between critical thinking and other mental processes:

From my experience, it seems that critical thinking uniquely relates to emotions. Often critical thinking (associated closely with rational thinking) is presented as an antagonist to emotional experience. It is commonly assumed that if we act on emotions we are not acting on rational deliberation. However I don’t think that this is always the case. For example, we may be emotionally attached to a set of beliefs about the world, however if we understand that the beliefs serve an emotional function  even if they may be incorrect, one could argue that the rational thing to do would be holding the beliefs while recognising that they may not reflect reality in it’s entirety. After all, why can’t we distinguish between beliefs which we hold close as emotional attachments and beliefs that we examine in the workshop as tools we can use to understand the world around us?
Additionally, becoming aware of our emotional state is an important component of avoiding bias when we critically think. This does not mean that we have to suppress our emotions and pretend that they are not there, in fact it is the opposite. We want to be able to recognise our emotions so that we can notice when they begin bias our reasoning. 

Critical thought seems to bare overlaps with many other mental processes. For example, creativity is required to see the possible pitfalls of arguments. Wheras we could also say that the whole process of critical thought is to critique pre-existing arguments instead of generating more. Similarly, critical thinking can be seen as a vital process in problem solving. Critical thinking allows us to evaluate solution before carrying them out. However, we wouldn’t say that critical thinking is the entire process of problem solving. A more unexpected comparison may be with socialising. When we are socialising and critically thinking, it could be argued that we are reflecting in both cases. However, how we reflect is quite distinct between the two. It can be interesting to ponder the relationship between critical thinking and other mental processes as it seems that critical thinking bares similarities to yet is distinct from many mental processes.

## Summary

Critical thinking is about learning to evaluate information carefully, so that the beliefs and decisions we make rest on stronger reasoning rather than habit or assumption. This skill belongs not only to the world of abstraction; it applies directly to everyday choices, emotions, and problem-solving. By practising critical thinking, we become more aware of our reasoning quality, whether we are making a strong generalisation, drawing a fair analogy, or identifying a genuine cause rather than mistaking correlation for causation.
The strength of our reasoning matters. Poor reasoning, like hasty generalisations, weak analogies, or the post hoc fallacy, can lead us into errors or make us vulnerable to manipulation. Strong reasoning, on the other hand, allows us to form independent judgments, manage our emotions more thoughtfully, and approach problems efficaciously. Cultivating critical thinking takes consistent practice, but it can elevate many areas of life.
